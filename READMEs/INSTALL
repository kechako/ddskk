(1)APEL (A Portable Emacs Library) is required in order to install
   SKK.  Please make sure you have installed APEL 9.22 or later
   already.  It is available at:

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
or
    ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/apel/

(2)If you want to use SKK customization feature, make sure you have a
   correctly working version of custom with SKK.

   (a)If you use GNU Emacs 20 or XEmacs, SKK works correctly without
      any modifications or additional packages.

   (b)GNU Emacs 19.30 or later has custom feature by default, but to
      work correctly you should use better version,
      `custom-1.9962.tar.gz'.  It is available at: 

        ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/

      Apply patch skk-10/patch/custom-1.9962.patch to cus-face.el of
      the package.

      If you do not want to use SKK customization feature, you have
      to do nothing.  pcustom.el (required in skk-foreword.el) will
      find that you use old custom and provide emulation features
      requiring tinycustom.el.

   (c)GNU Emacs 19.28 does not have custom feature by default.  And it
      seems difficult to run `custom-1.9962.tar.gz' on 19.28.
      pcustom.el will find that you do not have a custom package, and
      require tinycustom.el, so you have to do nothing.  After load
      tinycustom.el, all `defcustom's defined in SKK package will be
      equal to `defvars'.

(3)Edit SKK-CFG as you like.  Maybe you need not to edit Makefile at
   all.  All customization can be done in SKK-CFG.

(4)Run `make'.  You can specify Emacs command name in command line.
   For examples, `make install EMACS=mule'

(5)If you want to know target directories to install without actual
   installation, run `make what-where' (or `make what-where-package'
   for XEmacs package install.  As to package install, see below (7).

(6)Run `make install' (You may have to be superuser).  
   You can specify Emacs command name in command line, like
   `make install EMACS=mule'

(7)If you want install SKK as a XEmacs package, run
   `make install-package'.

(8)Many variables/functions names have been changed.  You are strongly
   recommended to load skk-obsolete.el and

     M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.
