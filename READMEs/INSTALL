* APEL

APEL (A Portable Emacs Library) is required to install SKK.  Make sure
you have APEL 10.6 or later (It is highly recommened that you install
the latest release).  APEL is available at:

    http://cvs.m17n.org/elisp/APEL

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/

    ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/apel/

or
    http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk/apel/

* Get dictionaries and copy them to ./dic subdirectory.

If you do not have SKK dictionaries, get them from

  http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk/dic-ja.html

and copy them ./dic subdirectory.  You don't have to get all size of
dictionaries.  Maybe you want one of them.

* Edit SKK-CFG.

Edit SKK-CFG as you like.  Default value to be defined in SKK-MK is
described and commented.  If you use one of the variable, comment out
it, and specify your value.  Maybe you need not to edit Makefile at
all.  All customization can be done in SKK-CFG.

Or you can specify configuration of installation in the command line
instead of editing SKK-CFG (See next section).

* Run make

Run

    % make

You can specify Emacs command name in the command line. For examples,

    % make EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs

Also, in the command line you can specify any variables of capital
letters defined in SKK-MK.  For examples, if you want to install SKK
locally,

    % make PREFIX=~/

then all Emacs lisp programs will be installed into
`~/share/emacs/site-lisp/skk'.  You can examine SKK-CFG to know what
variables will effect install configuration.  All of those values
described in SKK-CFG (but commented out) are default.

* Detect directories to be install

If you want to know target directories to install without actual
installation, run

    % make what-where

or

    % make what-where-package

for XEmacs package install.  As to package install, see section
`package install' below.


* make install

Run `make install' (You may have to be superuser).  You can specify
Emacs command name in the command line, like

    % make install EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs

* package install

If you want install SKK as a XEmacs package, run

    % make install-package

* Obsolete check

Many variables/functions names have been changed.  You are strongly
recommended to load skk-obsolete.el and

    M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.

* Easy setup

You can easily setup SKK.  Put the following form in your .emacs.

   (require 'skk-setup)
