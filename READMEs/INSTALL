(1)Get APEL 9.21 or later and install it.  You can get latest APEL at;

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
or
    ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/apel/

(2)If you use Emacs 19 with mule feature, you may want custom package.
   If you don't have it, APEL provides dummy functions.

   (a)On GNU Emacs 20 or XEmacs, SKK should work correctly without any
      modifications or additional packages.

   (b)On GNU Emacs 19.30 or later has custom package by default, but
      you can get better version (custom-1.9962.tar.gz) at

        ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/

      Apply patch skk-10/lisp/patch/custom-1.9962.patch to
      cus-face.el of the package.

   (c)On GNU Emacs 19.28, SKK does not work with any custom package.
      You should use pcustom.el (or you have to use tinycustom.el
      directly) of APEL for an emulation purpose.

      (i)If you don't have any custom.el in directories of load-path,
         you have to do nothing.

      (ii)If you have installed a custom.el which does not work
          correctly with SKK but you can't delete it, you have to
          change;

            (require 'pcustom)

         line of skk-foreword.el to

            (require 'tinycustom)

         So all defcustoms in SKK package will be equal to defvars.

(3)Edit lisp/Makefile as you like.

(4)Run `make' and `make install' (You may have to be superuser).  You
   may want to run `make install-package' if you use XEmacs (package
   install).

(5)If you DO NOT install as a package of XEmacs, you have to set
   autoloads.  Copy skk-10/lisp/skk-autoloads.el to your load-path and 
   add following line to your .emacs;

     (require 'skk-autoloads)

(6)Many variables/functions names have been changed.  You are strongly
   recommended to load skk-obsolete.el and

     M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.
