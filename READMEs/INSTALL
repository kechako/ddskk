(1)APEL (A Portable Emacs Library) is required to install SKK.  Please
   make sure you have already installed APEL 9.22 or later.  It is
   available at:

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
or
    ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/apel/

(2)Make sure you have a correctly working version of custom with SKK.

   (a)If you use GNU Emacs 20 or XEmacs, SKK works correctly without
      any modifications or additional packages.

   (b)Custom package is originally bundled with GNU Emacs 19.30 or
      later.  However, programmer's interfaces of that custom (old
      custom) are totally different from ones of its current versions,
      and the old custom does not work with SKK.  For instance, the
      old version does not have a `defcustom' or `defface' interface.
      So if you want to use custom features, you should get a current
      version that work well on Emacs 19.30 or later,
      `custom-1.9962.tar.gz'.  It is available at: 

        ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/

      Apply patch skk-10/patch/custom-1.9962.patch to cus-face.el of
      the package.

      If you do not want to use SKK customization feature, you have
      to do nothing.  pcustom.el of APEL (required in skk-foreword.el)
      will find that you use the old custom and provide emulation
      features by tinycustom.el.

   (c)Custom package is not bundled with GNU Emacs 19.28 and 19.29.
      And it seems difficult to run `custom-1.9962.tar.gz' on 19.28
      and 19.29.  On those Emacsen pcustom.el will find that you do
      not have a custom package, and require tinycustom.el, so you
      have to do nothing.  After loading tinycustom.el, all
      `defcustom's defined in SKK package will be equal to `defvars'.

(3)Edit SKK-CFG as you like.  Default value to be defined in SKK-MK is 
   described and commented.  If you use one of the variable, comment
   out it, and specify your value.  Maybe you need not to edit
   Makefile at all.  All customization can be done in SKK-CFG.

   Or you can specify configuration of installation in the command
   line instead of editing SKK-CFG (See (4) below).

(4)Run

     % make

   You can specify Emacs command name in the command line. For
   examples,

     % make EMACS=mule

   Also, in the command line you can specify any variables of capital
   letters defined in SKK-MK.  For examples, if you want to install
   SKK locally,

     % make PREFIX=~/

   then all Emacs lisp programs will be installed into
   `~/share/emacs/site-lisp/skk'.  You can examine SKK-CFG to know
   what variables will effect install configuration.  All of those
   values described in SKK-CFG (but commented out) are default.

(5)If you want to know target directories to install without actual
   installation, run

     % make what-where

   or

     % make what-where-package

   for XEmacs package install.  As to package install, see below (7).

(6)Run `make install' (You may have to be superuser).  
   You can specify Emacs command name in the command line, like

     % make install EMACS=mule

(7)If you want install SKK as a XEmacs package, run

     % make install-package

(8)Many variables/functions names have been changed.  You are strongly
   recommended to load skk-obsolete.el and

     M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.
