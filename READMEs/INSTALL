(1)Get APEL 9.21 or later and install it.
   You can get latest APEL at

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
or
    ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/apel/

(2)If you use Emacs 19 with mule feature (such as the official release 
   of Mule 2.3 (based on Emacs 19.28) or Emacs 19.34+Mule 2.3), you
   may want custom package.  When you don't have custom package, APEL
   provides emulation feature.

   (a)It seems difficult that the official release of Mule 2.3 (based
      on Emacs 19.28) works well with custom package.  You should use
      pcustom.el/tinycustom.el of APEL for emulation purpose.

      (i)If you don't have any custom.el in a directory of load-path,
         you have to do nothing.

      (ii)If you have a custom.el which does not work correctly but
          you can't delete it, you have to change 

          (require 'pcustom)

         line of skk-foreword.el to

          (require 'tinycustom)

         So all defcustoms in SKK package are equal to defvars.

   (b)Emacs 19.30 or later has it by default, but you can get
      better version (custom-1.9962.tar.gz) at

        ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/

      Apply patch skk-10/lisp/patch/custom-1.9962.patch to
      cus-face.el.

   (c)GNU Emacs 20 or XEmacs should work correctly without any
      additional package.

(3)Edit lisp/Makefile as you like.

(4)Run `make' and `make install' (You may have to be superuser).  You
   may want to run `make install-package' if you use XEmacs (package
   install).

(5)If you DO NOT install as a package of XEmacs, you have to set
   autoloads.  Copy skk-10/lisp/skk-autoloads.el to your suitable
   default.el such as site-lisp/default.el.

(6)Many name of variables and functions are changed.  You are strongly
   recommended to load skk-obsolete.el and
     M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.
