This is the version 10 of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion
program, an input method of Japanese).   It consists of a simple core
and many optional programs which provide extensive features, however,
our target is to more simplify core, and more expand its optional
features.

If you want to join developing SKK 10.x, you can access its sources
via a cvs server on the Ring Server Openlab.  See CVS_digest to learn
briefly how to access the cvs server.

If you want to join the SKK Ring Server Openlab Mailing list, see
a description below.

SKK is under the GNU General Public License.  See COPYING for its
details.

Thank you.
