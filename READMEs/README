Daredevil SKK is a branch of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion
program, an input method of Japanese).  It forked from the maintrunk,
SKK version 10.56.  It consists of a simple core and many optional
programs which provide extensive features, however, our target is to
more simplify core, and more expand its optional features.

If you want to join developing Daredevil SKK, you can access its
sources via a cvs server on the Ring Server Openlab.  See
CVS_digest to learn briefly how to access the cvs server.
