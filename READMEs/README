Daredevil SKK is a version of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji
conversion program, an input method of Japanese) that has been
maintained by the SKK developing team at
http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk.

It consists of a simple core and many optional programs which provide
extensive features, however, our target is to more simplify core, and
more expand its optional features.

If you want to join developing Daredevil SKK, you can access its
sources via a cvs server on the Ring Server Openlab.  See
CVS_digest to learn briefly how to access the cvs server.
